Planning phase:
	Players determine active duty roster
	Players determine number of deployments
	Players activate "Preparations Phase" assets


Action Phase:

	Players assign deployments of parahumans to initiate conflicts
	    Any deployments in excess of those planned in the Planning Phase cost thrice the resources
	    Any assigned parahumans not set to active duty in the Planning Phase demand thrice the wages

	Players activate "Action Phase" and/or "Deployment" assets


Reaction Phase:

	Players assign deployments of parahumans to respond to conflicts or reinforce prior deployments in the Action Phase

	    Any deployments in excess of the planned capacity *left over from the Action Phase* cost thrice
	        e.g. Plan 4 deployments,
	             use 3 in Action Phase (no excess, 1 left),
	             use 3 in Reaction Phase (2 excess)
	             => 4 normal price, 2 triple price

	    Any assigned parahumans not set to active duty in the Planning Phase demand thrice the wages
	        Parahumans may not be deployed twice in the same round

	Players activate "Reaction Phase" and/or "Deployment" assets


Aftermath Phase:

	Conflicts are evaluated
	    Territory is lost or gained
	    Reputation is lost or gained
	    Resources are lost or gained
	    Parahumans are maimed or killed
	    Experience is gained by teams (if applicable)

	Parahumans, teams and factions reevaluate themselves

	    Any parahuman, team or faction with reputation < -10 leave the city, dissociate or collapse respectively.
	        Leaving parahumans are are removed from the game
	            If a faction leader is removed, the highest-rank parahuman becomes leader.
		    Dissociating teams create independent parahumans
		        Released parahumans leave the faction if applicable
		    Collapsing factions create independent teams

	    Reevaluations occur in that order: all parahumans, then all teams, then all factions

	Deployments demand their price and parahumans demand wages
	    Deployments take their toll first
	        If resources are insufficient, the deficit is transferred to the reputation of the faction leader
	    Parahumans then demand their wages
	        Players select which parahumans to pay
	        Unpaid parahumans leave the faction, taking their team (if applicable) with them

	Players can organize their command hierarchy, including
	    Firing and recruiting parahumans
	        Parahumans can only be parented directly to teams/factions with an alignment within one of their own.
	    Reassigning parahumans to and from teams
	        Each change (new parahuman or removed parahuman) deducts 1 point from each stat bonus, to a minimum of 0
	        Parahumans can only be parented directly to teams/factions with an alignment within one of their own.
	    Dissociating and forming teams
	        New teams have 0 to each stat bonus
	        Stat bonuses are automatically lost when a team dissociates
