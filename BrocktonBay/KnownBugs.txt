UI:
	Switching the player faction before the Domain tab is first opened causes the Domain tab to be empty when it is opened.
	Expanding an expander doesn't expand the size allocation
	Sometimes children don't disappear from parents' lists when murdered.

Performance:
	Severe memory leak or uncollected IDependables or something causing everything to slow down severely with more and more RefreshUI()s.

Notes:
	.NET framework used is 4.6, default mono install may not be up to date.
